# ACE-iOS Workshops
This repository contains 2 projects for [ACE](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gatorace/) + [sec@uf's](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ufsdc/) two part iOS workshop series.


###How to run/view this code?
- in your terminal, at the directory where you want this code to live, run `git clone https://github.com/UF-ACE/ACE-iOS.git`
- Doing this will basically "download" this repositroy and you will have a folder called "ACE-iOS" with the exact file structure of this repository.
- Or you can download this repo as zip.
- ACE-iOS contains two folders:
  - "TipCalculator" (Xcode project + code for part 1 of the workshop)
  -  "test" (Xcode project + code for part 2 of the workshop) (sorry about the name, we accidentally named it "test" and its too complicated to change the project name + folders + filepaths for an Xcode project lol) 


###Part1 
- The code for part 1 of the workshop can be found in the `TipCalculator` directory.
- in your finder, click on `TipCalculator.xcodeproj` to open the project in Xcode
